Additionally, I found the size to be a bit smaller than expected for the price I paid. It's possible that there are larger options available for the same cost. Despite these minor issues, I was pleased to receive the toy a day earlier than expected, which allowed me to enjoy playing with it before giving it to my daughter. Overall, I would recommend this panda plush toy to anyone who loves cute and cuddly companions."

One of the ears is a bit lower than the other, and I don't think that was designed to be asymmetrical. It's a bit small for what I paid for it though. I think there might be other options that are bigger for the same price.  It arrived a day earlier than expected, so I got to play with it myself before I gave it to my daughter.\\n\""
